  // TODO in Lab 5: Add your model code from previous labs
  // feel free to remove above example code
  // you will need to modify the model (getDish and getAllDishes) 
  // a bit to take the advantage of Angular resource service
  // check lab 5 instructions for details





  // Angular service needs to return an object that has all the
  // methods created in it. You can consider that this is instead
  // of calling var model = new DinnerModel() we did in the previous labs
  // This is because Angular takes care of creating it when needed.
